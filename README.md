# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
In today’s world data security is the major problem which is to be face. In order to secure data during communication, data storage and 
transmission we use Advance encryption standard(AES). AES is a symmetric block cipher intended to replace DES for commercial applications. The AES algorithms use to secure data from unauthorized user. The available AES algorithm is used for text data as well as for image data. In this project an image is given as input to AES encryption algorithm which gives encrypted output. This encrypted output is given as input to AES decryption algorithm and original image is regained as output. The AES algorithm for image encryption and decryption which synthesizes and simulated with the help of MATLAB. Hence the idea of cardless payment has arrived. This project focuses mainly on the security and ensures that no cyber attacks take place during the transactions. The security with the technique of cryptography. Cryptography is used to encrypt and decrypt the images of the user’s fingerprint and ensures the secure storage of the 
image in the database.
This project mainly focuses on increasing accuracy of the emotion being detected.
Detecting emotions from speech helps in the improvement of business marketing.
